STARSHIP TROOPERS: EXTERMINATION HACK 2026 🔥🎯

Undetected Starship Troopers: Extermination cheat — keyless external/internal hybrid for dominating co-op & PvP bug hunts (February 2026)!  
Silent Aimbot, ESP/Wallhack (bugs/players/resources/supplies), No Recoil, Radar, Infinite Ammo/Stamina, Speedhack, Streamproof & more 💀

Standalone .exe — no injector needed, run as admin and drop in.  
Works on latest Starship Troopers: Extermination (Season 2+ patches, BattlEye active).  
Status: Undetected low-key/closet (community tested, HWID spoof — rage/BattlEye waves ban fast) 🟢🟠

Why this hack survives BattlEye in 2026  
- Simple: .exe → Extermination → auto-load  
- Humanized closet: smoothing, FOV limits, visibility checks  
- Kernel BattlEye bypass — streamproof overlays  
- ESP: bugs (warriors, plasma, tankers), players, resources, supplies, objectives thru fog  
- Updates post-season/patch  
- No key/sub — loader style  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit (Steam / Epic)
